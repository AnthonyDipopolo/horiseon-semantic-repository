# <Horiseon-Semantic-Repository>

## Description
In this project I removed all the none semantic code in order to create smoother search engine optimization.  With improved search engine optimization the website will be pushed more by the search engine due to it meeting the semantic requirements.  Also the first link in the nav was fixed as that was not working properly.  Fianlly, with the updates code some of the css code no longer worked, therfore that code was fixed as well.
